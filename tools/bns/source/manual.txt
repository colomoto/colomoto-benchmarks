COMMANDS:
After downloading the file, you may need to change the file access permission to make it executable:

    chmod +x bns 

To run BNS in Linux or Windows Cygwin, use the command:

    ./bns input_file 

For example, if you use the Boolean network model of Arabidopsis thaliana as an input file, you will get the following output:

    ./bns arabidopsis.cnet
    101100110111011
    Attractor 1 is of length 1

    110110110011011
    Attractor 2 is of length 1

    100110110011011
    Attractor 3 is of length 1

    111100110111011
    Attractor 4 is of length 1

    010001000011100
    Attractor 5 is of length 1

    010001001011100
    Attractor 6 is of length 1

    001100110111011
    Attractor 7 is of length 1

    000110110011001
    Attractor 8 is of length 1

    000001000011100
    Attractor 9 is of length 1

    000001001011100
    Attractor 10 is of length 1

    The number of attractors is 10

INPUT FORMAT:
The input file starts with the statement:

    .v number_of_vertices 

which specifies the total number of vertices in the Boolean network. We assume that vertices are labeled from 1 to number_of_vertices.

Then, the description of Boolean functions associated to vertices follows in the following format:

    .n vertex's_label number_of_regulators list_of_labels_of_regulators
    input_values output_value
    ...
    input_values output_value 

For example, the description of a vertex labeled by 1 with two regulators labeled by 2 and 3, which has an associated function OR can be given as follows:

    .n 1 2 2 3
    00 0
    01 1
    10 1
    11 1 

Note, that it you need to enumerate both, the input assignments for which the function evaluates to 1, as well as the input the input assignments for which the function evaluates to 0.

One can use the symbol "-" meaning "both 0 and 1" to reduce the description of the input part:

    .n 1 2 2 3
    00 0
    -1 1
    1- 1 

A line which starts with "#" is commented out. Comments are useful for relating labels of vertices to the actual names of genes.

As an example, see the input description of the Boolean network model of Arabidopsis thaliana.
